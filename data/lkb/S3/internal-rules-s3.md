# Company Internal S3 Bucket Policy Document

## Purpose

This document outlines the internal policies for naming, managing, and securing Amazon S3 buckets within our organization. Compliance with these policies ensures operational efficiency, data security, and alignment with regulatory requirements.

## Naming Convention

1. **Prefix Requirement:** All S3 bucket names must begin with the prefix "XPTO-" to signify they are managed under company policies. For example, an S3 bucket containing marketing materials may be named "XPTO-marketing-materials".

2. **Environment Indication:** Immediately following the prefix, the bucket name must include an abbreviation indicating the environment it belongs to, such as "dev", "test", or "prod". Example: "XPTO-prod-sales-data".

3. **Descriptive Name:** After the environment indication, the bucket name should include a clear, descriptive name that reflects its contents or intended use. Use hyphens (-) to separate words. Example: "XPTO-dev-app-logs".

4. **No Personal Identifiable Information (PII):** Bucket names must not contain any personal identifiable information or sensitive data descriptors.

## Security Policies

1. **Encryption:** All S3 buckets must have server-side encryption (SSE) enabled using either Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys.

2. **Public Access:** Buckets must not be publicly accessible unless explicitly approved by the security team. The default bucket policy must explicitly deny public access.

3. **Access Logging:** Enable access logging for all S3 buckets to track requests and ensure auditing capability.

4. **Versioning:** Enable versioning on all S3 buckets to protect against accidental deletions and overwrites.

5. **Cross-Region Replication:** Consider enabling cross-region replication for critical data to ensure availability in case of regional AWS failures.

## Compliance and Monitoring

1. **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular audits of S3 bucket policies and configurations to ensure compliance with these internal rules.

2. **Automated Alerts:** Set up automated alerts for non-compliant configurations or suspicious access patterns using AWS CloudWatch or a similar monitoring tool.

3. **Documentation:** Maintain documentation for each S3 bucket, including its purpose, configuration, and any exceptions to standard policies.

## Enforcement

Failure to adhere to these policies may result in access revocation, remediation actions, and potential disciplinary measures. It is the responsibility of each team and individual to ensure compliance with these policies.

This document serves as a foundational guide for managing Amazon S3 buckets within our organization and may be updated as necessary to reflect changes in company policy or AWS features.
