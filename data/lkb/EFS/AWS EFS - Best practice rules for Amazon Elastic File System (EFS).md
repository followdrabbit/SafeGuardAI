* [AWS KMS Customer Master Keys for EFS Encryption](/cloudoneconformity-staging/knowledge-base/aws/EFS/efs-encrypted-with-kms-customer-master-keys.html)
  
  Ensure EFS file systems are encrypted with KMS Customer Master Keys (CMKs) in order to have full control over data encryption and decryption.
